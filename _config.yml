# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I am a PhD student in the Sociology department at UCLA.  I just completed fieldwork
  for my dissertation, which will focus on Japan's Technical Intern Trainee Program
  and the recently implemented Specified Skilled WOrker Visa Regime.  My research is
  mainly focused on labor migration in East and Southeast Asia, the migration
  industries that facilitate these movements, and the changing familial and social
  contexts migrants draw from during their migrations.
